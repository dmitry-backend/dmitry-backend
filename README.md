# Hi, I’m Dmytro 👋
Junior Backend Developer focused on **Python async backend development**.  
I build real-world backend projects using modern async tools, with strong attention to correctness, structure, and reliability.

## 🧠 What I Focus On
- **Constant and effective learning** to improve backend skills as fast as possible
- Designing **clean, async REST APIs**
- Working with **PostgreSQL** using async SQLAlchemy
- Building **authentication, caching, background tasks**
- Writing **unit and integration tests** to ensure backend reliability
- Structuring projects using **real-world backend architecture principles**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Async SQLAlchemy  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL (SQL)  
- **Caching & Tasks:** Redis, Celery  
- **Security:** JWT, Argon2, bcrypt  
- **Testing:** pytest, HTTPX, async testing  
- **Migrations:** Alembic  
- **Tools:** Git, Docker  

## 🚀 Projects Overview
I maintain several backend-focused projects that reflect different learning stages and goals:

- **Main Project:** a full-featured async backend demonstrating end-to-end backend development (auth, caching, background tasks, testing).
- **Testing Practice:** focused repository dedicated to async unit and integration testing patterns.
- **First Async Project:** early CRUD API built to master async SQLAlchemy and backend fundamentals.

👉 See pinned repositories below for details.

## 🧩 Background Strength
Before software development, I spent **16 years in psychology and coaching**.  
This translates into:
- clear communication and collaboration
- reliability in team environments
